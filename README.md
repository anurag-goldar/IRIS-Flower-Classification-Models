# 🌸 IRIS Flower Classification

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is about classifying Iris flowers into three species (**Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**) using **Machine Learning**. The dataset used is the famous **Iris Flower Dataset**, and the classification model is built using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree** from Scikit-Learn.

## 📂 Files in This Repository

- `IRIS_Flower_Classification.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `IRIS Flower.csv` - Dataset containing measurements of Iris flowers.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of **150 samples**, each with the following features:

- **Sepal Length (cm)**
- **Sepal Width (cm)**
- **Petal Length (cm)**
- **Petal Width (cm)**
- **Species** (Target variable: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anurag-goldar/IRIS-Flower-Classification-Models.git
   cd IRIS-Flower-Classification-Models
   
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook IRIS_Flower_Classification.ipynb

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Load the dataset and visualize it.
2. Perform data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.).
3. Train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
4. Evaluate the model using accuracy and other performance metrics.
5. Make predictions on new data.

## 📈 Models Used

1. Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.
2. Logistic Regression for classification.
3. Decision Tree for classification.
4. Evaluation using accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.

## 📜 Results

1. Achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset (update this based on your model performance).
2. The models effectively classify different species of the Iris flower.

## 🖼 Visualizations Included

1. Data distribution plots
2. Correlation heatmap
3. SVM decision boundary (if applicable)
